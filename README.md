# [Tatum Public Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/tatumio/projects/6) üõ£Ô∏è

At Tatum we're fanatical about the developer experience. That's why our public roadmap is shaped from feedback received from awesome devs like **you**. We want your feedback. Here's how you can give it.

# [How to: add a proposal](https://github.com/tatumio/roadmap/discussions) üìÉ

Step 3: Use the `Feature Requests` category for your proposal. (If you need help or found a bug do feel free to open a discussion for that though!)

# What happens when you create a Proposal ü§î
Upon submitting your proposal, one of our Developer Evangelists will promptly pick it up, marking it with the 'In review' label.

</p>

Next, we forward your request to our product team. If they have any questions or feedback, they'll discuss it directly within the issue thread and you'll receive a notification.

Upon acceptance of your proposal, the 'In review' label will be replaced with either 'Accepted' and additional relevant tags, or simply 'Declined' if it's not feasible at the time.

# Tracking the status of a Proposal üïí
Once your proposal gets accepted you can track the progress and updates about the proposal on our public roadmap board, which you can [find here](https://github.com/orgs/tatumio/projects/6/views/1).

# Upvoting/Downvoting a current Proposal üëç
If you're considering making a feature request, it's possible that someone else may have already submitted a similar proposal. We encourage you to explore existing requests and engage in the discussions. If you find a proposal that aligns with your needs, show your support by participating in the conversation and upvoting the issue.
