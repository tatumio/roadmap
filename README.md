# What happens when you create a Proposal 🤔
So as soon as you create a proposal one of our Developer Evangalists picks it up & adds the labels "In review" tag.

We then share the request with the product team and comes up with the questions and feedbacks if any to discuss about the Proposal in the same issue and you get notified about same.

And as soon as the proposal gets accepted you will see the "In review" tag replaced with either "Accepted" and other relevant tags or just "Declined".

# Tracking the status of a Proposal 🕒
Once your proposal gets accepted you can track the progress and updates about the proposal in our public roadmap board, which you can [find here](https://github.com/orgs/tatumio/projects/6/views/1).

# Upvoting/Downvoting a current Proposal 👍
While you are curious about a specific feature request and you might be on way to create a proposal it might be the case that it might have already been requested and in that case we recommend you to participate in the discussions of the issue & upvote a proposal if you liked.
